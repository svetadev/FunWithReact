# FunWithReact
Just have fun with react-native/redux/react-native-router-flux

## Requirements
 Used Github Rest API https://developer.github.com/v3/
 - On main screen of app there are top repositories sorted by stars with number of stars, watchers and open issues.
 - On top of page there is the search input with possibility to search by repo name (sort by stars).
 - When pressing on repository item the additional repo information is shown with list of the last 10 pull requests with author, name, number and status.

### How it looks
